This example accompanies the "Quick Start" guide that is part of the Spotify
Embedded SDK Documentation.

To build the example with GCC on Linux or on OS X, run "make".

To build the example on other platforms or using other toolchains, please adapt
the Makefile to your needs or convert it to your own build system.

The example requires a file named "spotify_appkey.key" containing a
Spotify Application Key in binary form. You can find more information about
Application Keys on the Spotify Developer web site.

The application-specific code is contained in the file "sp_util.c".
This file contains stubs for most functions, including the functions needed for
actual audio playback. Search for "TODO" to find code that you might want to
replace.
